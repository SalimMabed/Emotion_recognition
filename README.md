#Emotion Recognition
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize emotions from images. It includes several scripts to organize images by emotion (data_clean.m), train a CNN model (CNN.m), visualize convolution filters (conv.m), and test the model with a graphical user interface (real_test.m). This project facilitates automatic emotion recognition from images using MATLAB.
